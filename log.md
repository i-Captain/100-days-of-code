# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0.0 - 15. July 2020

I am starting with a couple of zero days, since I go on vacation in August and the notebook doesn't come along ;) So the real challenge will start end of August.

### Preparation for the #100DaysOfCode challenge. 

The challenge includes several projects:
- todo app (flutter firebase & sqlite)
- Work Life Balance app (flutter moor)
- simple flutter timetracking app
- ESCR (motivation flutter app)

> Thats quite a scope, but X preparation days plus 100 days means 150 to 300 hours... We'll see what's possible.

### Additional tasks:
- Design
- UX
- Plattform specific behaviors and guidelines
- Setup Apple Store
- Data Privacy
- Internationalization

#### While preparing my flutter sdk, playground and projects, i found a Flutter Version Management package
I'll have a ['spike'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_(software_development)) on this later in the 100 days of flutter coding.

#### Some inspirations

https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=100DaysOfCode%20flutter&src=typed_query

#### Today's Progress:
Started project txtty with desktop macos enabled. Installed [supercharged](http://pub.dev/packages/) which only works iOS, Android and web (but who knows... until userstory 'parse_chat_messages', this could change). Added simple BottomNavigationBar with 3 empty views (dashboard, chats, settings).

#### Thoughts:
Thought i could use a shortcut with [settings_ui](https://pub.dev/packages/settings_ui) - but this package supports only iOS and Android.

> The example of settings_ui uses [device_preview](https://pub.dev/packages/device_preview) - **that's a todo for the userstory 'flutter and responsive layout'**.

In my ESCR project i use the [shared_preferences_settings](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences_settings) package, wich supports web. But i think there was a textColor issue with my dark theme. I'll check this later, when i am working on that project.

> ToFigureOut - How much additional time will it cost, to log the 100 days?

## Day 0.1 - 16. July 2020

#### Today's Progress:
Lost in state management. Cloned and tested so many different flutter architecture examples. Read and watched countless tutorials. I am confused.

## Day 0.2 - 17. July 2020

#### Today's Progress:
Found [flutter get/getx](https://pub.dev/packages/get) package, which looks very promising. Created a new playground for only moor, statemanagement and firebase.

Playing again with moor code/examples. Upgraded the [ResoCoder/flutter-moor-tutorial](https://github.com/ResoCoder/flutter-moor-tutorial) to moor_flutter: ^3.1.0 (this example uses MultiProvider and DAOs).

The [flutter moor todo example from Rody Davis](https://github.com/rodydavis/moor_shared) uses rxdart and 'blocs'.

#### Thoughts:
Routing with GetX looks so easy. And i'll fixed some null problems in the todo_getx code to run it on the Simulator. All in all a good day with more flutter moor findings.

## Day 0.3 - 18. July 2020

#### Today's Progress:
Forked #100DaysOfCode. Moved and converted the content from my blog post to this log  
Created 'journals' for each project in Paper App  

![](assets/0.3-project-journal-screenshot.jpeg)

First look at the eatsleepcoderepeat code. So alpha... that has to be a fresh start with some steps from

> The optional not-so-optional steps that flutter doesn't mention when creating your project.
https://dash-overflow.net/articles/getting_started/

#### Thoughts:
Feels demanding to switch between the projects. I hope this is the 'project cleanup/setup phase'.

#### ToDo:
- Create new eatsleepcoderepeat flutter project  
- Record times for logging

## Day 0.4 - 19. July 2020

#### Today's Progress:
Created new flutter project. Checked my ['dart settings'](https://dartcode.org/docs/recommended-settings/) in vscode. Used (regex) search and replace ```//.*``` to remove the flutter main.dart boilerplate comments.

Implemented [analysis_options.yaml](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/analysis_options.yaml) which was one step from [RÃ©mi Rousselets article](https://dash-overflow.net/articles/getting_started/). The linting step is a later todo.

Played with [json](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/json) and [shared_preferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences)

Moved and fixed first code from old project to eat_sleep_repeat.

#### Thoughts:
Renamed project to eat_sleep_repeat. The code part is too specific for an app name but was really a lifesaver during the past few months.

From [shared_preferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences): There is no guarantee that writes will be persisted to disk after returning, so this plugin must not be used for storing critical data.

Not critical, but a bad user experience, if the stored  'motivations' are lost.

So there is a todo, maybe the [localstorage package](https://pub.dev/packages/localstorage/) will solve this. 

#### Links:
https://medium.com/better-programming/flutter-how-to-save-objects-in-sharedpreferences-b7880d0ee2e4  
https://codingwithjoe.com/flutter-saving-and-restoring-with-sharedpreferences/

#### ToDo:
Test the [localstorage package](https://pub.dev/packages/localstorage/)  
Fix wired output [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55399209/update-flutter-dependencies-in-pub-cache)

#### Todays Takeaway:
Enabled [flutter-ui-guides](https://dartcode.org/releases/v3-1/#preview-flutter-ui-guides) (restart vscode) and installed [pubspec-assist](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jeroen-meijer.pubspec-assist) this could be very useful. Less pub.dev search package and copy to pubspec.yaml


## Day 0.5 - 20. July 2020

#### Today's Progress:
Implemented a drawer. Found after i watched a [talk](https://youtu.be/FCyoHclCqc8) from the flutter europe conference 2020. [drawer_challenge](https://github.com/MarcinusX/drawer_challenge)

Added 'GetX' and implemented first controller for the logic stuff.

Played with sliders (link below)

#### Thoughts:
I'll have to reduce the features for stept 1. Remembered the agile [skateboard](https://m.dotdev.co/the-agile-bicycle-829a83b18e7) 

#### Links:
https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_xlider/  
https://fidev.io/complex-ui/

#### ToDo:
Use/Test [get_storage](https://pub.dev/packages/get_storage) for step 1 instead of shared_preferences or the localstorage package

## Day 0.6 - 21. July 2020

#### Today's Progress:
Fixed 'disable onDoubleTap' in HomeView if drawer is open. Removed sliders. Implemented get_storage to 'observe' the TextField value onChange and save it.

#### Thoughts:
Lost in GetX. It's late. Let go and start fresh tomorrow.

#### ToDo:
Use a model with 'word', 'xcord','ycord' etc.

#### Todays Takeaway:
Always a good idea to 'inspect' the used widget (see highlight;)

> **Highlight:**
There is a maxLength for TextField...
